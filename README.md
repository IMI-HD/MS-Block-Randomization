# MS-Block-Randomization

The randomization aims to reduce the influence of "potential" mass spec performance fluctuations over time. 
Therefore, it is mostly important when running cohorts of e.g. > 1 day.
Within one day an MS lab can run ~ 12-16 samples. 
Thus, the randomization is more important for cohorts > 12-16 samples.
